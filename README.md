# Raventale-TFG-proyect-
Old documents rescued from my TFG, an android program, using Java, Firebase and customizations.  Raventale was born with the premise of creating a nest, where users could access and share small micro-stories with other users. It is a TFG project, so it is not much, but I have a special affection for it.
